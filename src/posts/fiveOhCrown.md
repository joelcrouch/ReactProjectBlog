# Chasing the Triple 5-O Crown

A 50K trail race. A sub-5:00 mile. Fifty batches of cookies. One feels doable, one’s a stretch, and one might be the sweetest challenge of all.

It’s easy to write these goals on paper, but the reality is messier:

- **50K trail:** It’s not just about distance. It’s hills, uneven terrain, and hours on your feet. Training is slow, steady, and sometimes painfully boring (hello, Zone 2).  

- **Sub-5:00 mile:** Short, fast, and unforgiving. Speed workouts push you into discomfort you didn’t know existed, and bad days can feel discouraging.  Here's a tip: if you don't want to have a bad interval workout, skip the interval workout.  

- **50 batches of cookies:** Sounds trivial… until you realize eating that many cookies responsibly is its own ultra challenge, and baking 50 times in a year requires planning, energy, and a little obsession.

Some days, I want to run another Zone 2 workout. Yep. Running with my heart rate under 140 bpm is 'super exciting.' Okay, it does have its grand moments — when your playlist hits just right with your mood, the weather is perfect, or the book you’re listening to gets to a really scintillating part about 'failover,' and you think, "Wow, that is a really cool idea. Who thought that up?" Well, anybody could, dingdong.

Anyways, running, like cycling, takes some time to really enjoy. I found out it takes me over 25 minutes to start feeling good. Anything less is kinda yucky. I get why people don’t like running. They don’t run long enough. Sounds backwards, but give it a try.

Some days I wake up excited for an interval session. Other days, Garmin suggests a VO₂ max workout, and I stare at it for a minute before muttering, “Pass.” Motivation ebbs. Work, life, and energy levels fluctuate. That’s part of the journey.

Also, garmin, please, let me have my data.  Ok, fine. I will write an app that lets me grab it and put it into golden-cheetah.  

Some days I can gobble down a dozen cookies, no problem. Other days, the motivation is lacking. Tough problem to have.

This blog will track the wins, the skipped workouts, the data, and yes, the cookies. Along the way, I hope to figure out how to keep moving toward the Triple 5-O Crown, especially even when it feels hard.

**Running far. Running slow. Baking often.**
